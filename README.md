# URBAN5160 — Advanced Topics for Urban Analytics  
## GNN: Graph Modelling and Spatial-Explicit GeoAI for Urban Analytics

This repository hosts **Jupyter notebook–based teaching materials** for **URBAN5160: Advanced Topics for Urban Analytics**.

The materials support two sessions on **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, focusing on **graph modelling** and **spatial-explicit GeoAI** methods for urban analytics. The notebooks combine conceptual explanations with hands-on workflows for building urban graphs, training GNN models, and interpreting results in spatial contexts.

## Sessions Covered

This repository contains materials for two URBAN5160 sessions:

- **Session 1 — Graph Modelling for Urban Analytics**  
  Constructing urban graphs (nodes/edges), encoding spatial relationships, and preparing graph-structured data for learning.

- **Session 2 — Spatial-Explicit GeoAI with Graph Neural Networks**  
  Applying GNNs to spatial prediction tasks and discussing uncertainty, generalisation, and interpretability in urban settings.

Each session includes:
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- Lightweight datasets (where applicable)
- Step-by-step exercises and discussion prompts
